# Differentiation for S4TF

The [Differentiation](https://github.com/philipturner/differentiation) package requires importing Differentiation like this:

```swift
import Differentiation
```

Swift for TensorFlow requires importing Differentiation like this:
```swift
import _Differentiation
```

This is a (failed) attempt to circumvent the naming issue.
